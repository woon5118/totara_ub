Feature: Test competencies can be user assigned

  Background:
    Given I am on a totara site
    And the following "competency" frameworks exist:
      | fullname                 | idnumber | description                    |
      | Competency Framework One | CFrame   | Framework for Competencies     |
      | Competency Framework Two | CFrame 2 | Framework for Competencies too |
    And the following hierarchy types exist:
      | hierarchy  | idnumber    | fullname            |
      | competency | Comp type 1 | Competency Type One |
      | competency | Comp type 2 | Competency Type Two |


  Scenario: I can filter competencies and assign many to myself
