Feature: Tenant user manager without isolation

  As a tenant user manager
  In order to manage tenant users
  I want to be able to create, update and delete member accounts

  Background:
    Given I am on a totara site
    And tenant support is enabled without tenant isolation
    And the following config values are set as admin:
      | passwordpolicy | 0 |

  Scenario: Administrator may assing tenant user management to non-member without tenant isolation
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username          | firstname     | lastname |
      | tenantusermanager | Tenant User   | Manager  |
# Note: the non-member managing tenant does not have any UI that leads them to the tenant category,
#       workaround is to add totara/tenant:view capability in the system context, they can see
#       what tenants are there just by looking at course categories anyway.
    And the following "roles" exist:
      | name          | shortname    | archetype |
      | Tenant viewer | tenantviewer |           |
    And the following "permission overrides" exist:
      | capability                           | permission | role         | contextlevel | reference |
      | totara/tenant:view                   | Allow      | tenantviewer | System       |           |
    And the following "system role assigns" exist:
      | user              | role         |
      | tenantusermanager | tenantviewer |
    And I log in as "admin"
