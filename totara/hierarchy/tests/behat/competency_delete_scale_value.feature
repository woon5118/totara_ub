    Scenario: Delete Scale Value displays warnings of pathways to be deleted
      Given I log in as "admin"
      And I navigate to "Manage competencies" node in "Site administration > Competencies"
      And I click on "Deletable Value scale" "link"
      And I click on "Delete" "link" in the "Intermediate" "table_row"
      Then I should see "Deleting the 'Intermediate' scale value will affect competencies that have achievement pathways defined against it."
      And I should see " A total of 3 achievement pathway(s) will be deleted."
      When I click on "Continue" "button"
      Then I should see "The competency scale value \"Intermediate\" has been deleted."
      And "Intermediate" "table_row" should not exist
