Feature: Check that the visibility options for the tiles work correctly
  The User should be able to hide the tile based on whether other users are in an audience or they match some
  preset rules.
  The User should be able to set aggregation options for all of these so they can make sure they can hide the tile from
  the people they want while showing it to the people who need to see it.
