  Background:
    Given I am on a totara site
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email               |
      | teacher1 | Terry1    | Teacher1 | teacher1@moodle.com |

      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |
      | student1 | C1     | student        |
    When I log in as "admin"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I add a "Seminar" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
