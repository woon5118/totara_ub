  Scenario: View main calendar
    Given I log in as "teacher1"
    And I click on "Find Learning" in the totara menu
    And I follow "Course 1"
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I add a "Face-to-face" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Name                                    | Test facetoface name        |

      | Show entry on user's calendar           | 1                           |
    And I follow "View all events"
    And I follow "Add a new event"
    And I fill facetoface session with relative date in form data:
      | datetimeknown         | Yes              |
      | sessiontimezone[0]    | Pacific/Auckland |

      | timestart[0][hour]    | 0                |
      | timestart[0][minute]  | 0                |
      | timefinish[0][day]    | +1               |

      | timefinish[0][minute] | 0                |
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I log out

    When I log in as "student1"
    And I click on "Calendar" "link"
#    Make step to see the date.
#    see calendar_format_event_time function to get the expected result.
    And I should see "(time zone: Pacific/Auckland)"
    And I log out
