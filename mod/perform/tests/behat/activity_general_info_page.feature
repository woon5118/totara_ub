Feature: Create and update activity general info fields
  As an activity administrator
  I need to be able to update general activity fields.

  Background:
    Given I am on a totara site
    And the following "activities" exist in "mod_perform" plugin:
      | activity_name       | description                     | activity_type | create_track | create_section | activity_status |
      | My Test Activity #1 | My Test Activity #1 description | check-in      | true         | true           | Active          |
      | My Test Activity #2 | My Test Activity #2 description | check-in      | true         | true           | Draft           |

  Scenario: Populate the general info fields for a new activity
