  As an activity administrator
  I need to be able to manage activities
  so that I can change them according to the needs.

  As an activity creator
  I need to be able to create activities

  Background:
    Given I am on a totara site
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                   |
      | john     | John      | One      | john.one@example.com    |

      | Active activity | An active activity | feedback      | Active          | 2000-01-01 |

  Scenario: Admin can access the activity management page
    Given I log in as "admin"
    When I navigate to the manage perform activities page
    # The admin should always see all existing activities
    Then I should see the tui datatable contains:

      | Draft activity  | Feedback | Draft  |
      | Active activity | Feedback | Active |
    And "Participation reporting" "link" should exist

  Scenario: User can access the activity management page and create an activity given the right capabilities
    Given I log in as "admin"
    # To create an activity you need both create capabilities, in mod_perform and in the container
    And I set the following system permissions of "Authenticated user" role:

    # For activities created by the user the reporting link should be there
    And "Participation reporting" "link" should not exist in the ".tui-performActivityActions" "css_element"

  Scenario: User can access the activity management page and manage activities given the right capabilities
    Given I log in as "admin"
    # To create an activity you need both create capabilities, in mod_perform and in the container
