Feature: Adding and removing participant to a perform activity section

  Background:
    Given the following "activities" exist in "mod_perform" plugin:
      | activity_name             | create_section | create_track | activity_status |
      | Participant set up test   | true           | true         | Draft           |
      | Multiple section Activity | true           | true         | Draft           |
    And the following "activity sections" exist in "mod_perform" plugin:
      | activity_name             | section_name |
      | Multiple section Activity | Section B    |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to the manage perform activities page

  Scenario: Add and remove single participant to a section
    When I click on "Participant set up test" "link"
    Then the "Content" tui tab should be active
    And I should see no perform activity participants

    When I click the add responding participant button
    Then the mod perform responding participants popover should match:
      | name              | checked | enabled |
      | Subject           | 0       | 1       |

      | Appraiser         | 0       | 1       |

    When I select "Subject" in the responding participants popover then click cancel
    Then I should not see "Activity saved"

    # Test canceling out of selections does not retain them (selections are blown away on every open of the popover).
    When I click the add responding participant button
    Then the mod perform responding participants popover should match:
      | name              | checked | enabled |

    Then I should see "Activity saved" in the tui success notification toast and close it
    And I should see "Subject" as the perform activity participants

    Then the "Content" tui tab should be active
    And I should see no perform activity participants

    When I select "Manager" in the responding participants popover
    Then I should see "Activity saved" in the tui success notification toast

    When I close the tui notification toast
    And I click the add view-only participant button
    # Note that despite Manager belonging to the responding group it will is intending to not show checked in the view-only group.
    Then the mod perform view-only participants popover should match:

    Then I should see "Activity saved" in the tui success notification toast

    When I close the tui notification toast
    And I click the add responding participant button

    # Note that despite Manager already being selected in this group it should still not show ticked, this is intentional.
    Then the mod perform responding participants popover should match:
