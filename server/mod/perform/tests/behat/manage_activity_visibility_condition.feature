Feature: As an activity administrator, I need to be able to update visibility condition
  so that I can control when answers are displayed to users

  Background:
    Given I am on a totara site
    And the following "activities" exist in "mod_perform" plugin:
      | activity_name     | description                  | activity_type | create_track | create_section | activity_status |
      | My Test Activity  | My Test Activity description | check-in      | true         | false          | Draft           |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email             |
      | user1    | user      | 1        | user1@example.com |
      | user2    | user      | 2        | user2@example.com |
    And the following "cohorts" exist:
      | name | idnumber |
      | aud1 | aud1     |
    And the following "cohort members" exist:
      | user  | cohort |
      | user1 | aud1   |
      | user2 | aud1   |
    And the following "activity sections" exist in "mod_perform" plugin:
      | activity_name    | section_name |
      | My Test Activity | section 1    |
    And the following "section relationships" exist in "mod_perform" plugin:
      | section_name | relationship |
      | section 1    | subject      |
    And the following "section elements" exist in "mod_perform" plugin:
      | section_name | element_name |
      | section 1    | short_text   |

  Scenario: Change anonymous response setting should affect visibility control
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to the manage perform activities page

    When I click on "My Test Activity" "link"
    And I click on "General" "link"
    Then ".tui-radioGroup" "css_element" should exist
    And the "Anonymise responses" tui form row toggle switch should be "off"
    # visibility condition should be read only and set to 'all participants' when anonymous response is enabled
    When I toggle the "Anonymise responses" tui form row toggle switch
    Then ".tui-radioGroup" "css_element" should not be visible
    And I should see "Response submission is closed for all participants"
    # If toggled back, the visibility condition selected will be “All responding participants”
    # regardless of what was selected before anonymise had been toggled on.
    When I toggle the "Anonymise responses" tui form row toggle switch
    Then ".tui-radioGroup" "css_element" should exist
    And the "Response submission is closed for all participants" radio button is selected
    And I click on "Save changes" "button"

  Scenario: Show warning message on saving changes when condition is not none and automatic closure is disabled
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to the manage perform activities page

    When I click on "My Test Activity" "link"
    Then ".tui-notificationBanner" "css_element" should not exist
    # Situation: automatic closure disabled & visibility condition is none
    When I click on "General" "link"
    Then the "None (submitted responses immediately visible to viewers)" radio button is selected
    And ".tui-notificationBanner" "css_element" should not exist
    # Situation: automatic closure disabled & visibility condition is not none
    When I click on the "Response submission is closed for the participant who is viewing" tui radio
    And I click on "Save changes" "button"
    And I should see "This condition cannot be met by participants without manual intervention, because automatic closure is currently disabled. Enable it as a workflow setting on the \"Content\" tab." in the tui warning notification banner
    When I click on "Content" "link" in the ".tui-tabs__tabs" "css_element"
    And I should see "Closure is set as a condition for response visibility, but this cannot be met by participants without manual intervention while automatic closure is disabled. Enable it, or change the visibility condition on the \"General\" tab to \"None\"." in the ".tui-performActivityWorkflowSettings__warning" "css_element"
    # Situation: automatic closure enabled & visibility condition is not none
    When I toggle the "Automatic closure" tui form row toggle switch
    Then I should not see "Closure is set as a condition for response visibility, but this cannot be met by participants without manual intervention while automatic closure is disabled. Enable it, or change the visibility condition on the \"General\" tab to \"None\"."
    And I click on "General" "link"
    Then I should not see "This condition cannot be met by participants without manual intervention, because automatic closure is currently disabled. Enable it as a workflow setting on the \"Content\" tab."

  Scenario: Visibility control should be editable after activation if anonymous response is not enabled
    Given I log in as "admin"

    And I click on "Add group" "button"
    And I click on "Audience" "link" in the ".tui-dropdown__menu" "css_element"
    And I toggle the adder picker entry with "aud1" for "Audience name"
    And I save my selections and close the adder
    And I reload the page
    And I click on "Activate" "button" in the ".tui-actionCard" "css_element"
    And I confirm the tui confirmation modal
    Then I should see "was successfully activated." in the tui success notification toast

    Then ".tui-radioGroup" "css_element" should exist
    And the "Response submission is closed for the participant who is viewing" radio button is selected
