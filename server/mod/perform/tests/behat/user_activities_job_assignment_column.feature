    And I run the scheduled task "mod_perform\task\create_subject_instance_task"

  Scenario: Job assignment column shows when a subject instance with a specific job assignment is listed.
    Given I log in as "mark"
    And I navigate to the outstanding perform activities list page

    # Tests job assignment column isn't shown when all the subject instances are not created per job assignment
    Then I should see the tui datatable contains:
      | Activity title             | Type      | Overall progress | Your progress   |
      | Another Subject assignment | Appraisal | Not yet started  | Not yet started |
      | Subject assignment         | Appraisal | Not yet started  | Not yet started |

    When I click on "Activities about others" "link"

    # Tests job assignment column is shown when any of the subject instances are created per job assignment
    Then I should see the tui datatable contains:
      | Activity title           | Type      | User         | Job assignment                   | Relationship to user | Overall progress | Your progress   |
