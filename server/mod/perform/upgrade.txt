information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 13.2 ===

* respondable_element_plugin::validate_response() function now includes new parameter 'is_draft_validation'
  to check response validation in draft mode. This function signature changed to abstract function and all respondable
  elements should implement this method.
* Deprecated mod_perform\models\activity\element::get_section_element - elements are designed to be reused more than once.
* activity_setting::create() function no longer checks if the current user has permission to manage the activity. The
  check should be performed before calling this function, where applicable.
* Deprecated the following methods:
    * track_user_assigned_bulk::create_from_user_assignments(); use
      track_user_assigned_bulk::create_from_track_assignment instead.
* Notification settings are no longer lazy-loaded, and instead notification records are created upon the creation of
  the activity itself. There is now no longer a distinction between 'real' and 'sparse' notifications.
  The following have been deprecated as part of this change:
  * GraphQL query mod_perform_create_notification has been deprecated, please update all calls to mod_perform_toggle_notification
  * GraphQL type mod_perform_create_notification_result has been deprecated, please update all calls to mod_perform_toggle_notification_result
  * GraphQL input mod_perform_create_notification_input has been deprecated, please update all calls to mod_perform_toggle_notification_input
  * \mod_perform\webapi\resolver\mutation\create_notification - use \mod_perform\webapi\resolver\mutation\toggle_notification instead.
  * \mod_perform\models\activity\details\notification_sparse - notifications are no longer lazy loaded, please use
    \mod_perform\models\activity\notification instead.
  * \mod_perform\models\activity\details\notification_real - all functionality has been moved into
    \mod_perform\models\activity\notification so use that instead.
  * \mod_perform\models\activity\details\notification_interface - interface is no longer necessary
  * \mod_perform\models\activity\notification::__construct() - no longer needs to inherit it's parent constructor.
  * \mod_perform\models\activity\notification::get_class_key() - reference the class_key property directly instead.
  * \mod_perform\models\activity\notification::get_active() - reference the active property directly instead.
  * \mod_perform\models\activity\notification::delete() - notification records should not be manually deleted.
  * \mod_perform\models\activity\notification::exists() - redundant as notifications will always exist.
  * \mod_perform\models\activity\notification_recipient::__construct() - no longer needs to inherit it's parent constructor.
  * \mod_perform\models\activity\notification_recipient::get_notification_id() - reference the core_notification_id property directly instead.
  * \mod_perform\models\activity\notification_recipient::get_active() - reference the active property directly instead.
* GraphQL type mod_perform_my_subject_instance now support pagination. Actual results are returned in items.
* GraphQL query mod_perform_my_subject_instances now return mod_perform_subject_sections_page which include items as well as pagination information
* \mod_perform\classes\models\activity\element_plugin::get_participant_response_component() - should only be used on respondable_element_plugin and classes extending it.
* \mod_perform\models\activity\details\subject_instance_notification::load_by_activity() is deprecated; instead load
  subject instances using the subject instance repository, then subject_instance_notification::load_by_subject_instance().
