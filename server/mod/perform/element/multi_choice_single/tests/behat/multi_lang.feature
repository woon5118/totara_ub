Feature: Multiple choice element supports multi-lang filters in titles and options

  Background:
    Given I am on a totara site
    And I log in as "admin"
    Given the following "activities" exist in "mod_perform" plugin:
      | activity_name        | create_section | create_track | activity_status |
      | Add Element Activity | true           | true         | Draft           |

    # Enabling multi-language filters for headings and content.
    And the multi-language content filter is enabled

  Scenario: Set multi-lang text as question title and for options of the multiple choice element type and make sure it's displayed correctly
    Given I navigate to the manage perform activities page
    And I click on "Add Element Activity" "link"

    # Adding a new item
    And I navigate to manage perform activity content page
    And I add a "Multiple choice: single-select" activity content element
    Then "rawTitle" "field" should be visible
    When I set the following fields to these values:
      | rawTitle   | <span lang="en" class="multilang">it's an English question</span><span lang="de" class="multilang">deutsche Frage</span> |
      | options[0][value] | <span lang="en" class="multilang">it's the first option</span><span lang="de" class="multilang">erste Option</span>      |
      | options[1][value] | <span lang="en" class="multilang">it's the second option</span><span lang="de" class="multilang">zweite Option</span>    |
    # Currently a changed text won't be filtered until saved
    And I save the activity content element
    And I close the tui notification toast
    Then I should see "it's an English question"
    When I click on the Edit element button for question "it's an English question"
    Then the following fields match these values:
      | rawTitle | <span lang="en" class="multilang">it's an English question</span><span lang="de" class="multilang">deutsche Frage</span> |
