      | Add Element Activity | true           | true         | Draft           |

    # Add multiple elements
    When I navigate to the edit perform activities page for activity "Add Element Activity"
    And I click on "Edit content elements" "link_or_button"
    And I add a "Text: Long response" activity content element
    When I set the following fields to these values:

      | identifier | Identifier 1 |
    And I click on the "responseRequired" tui checkbox
    And I save the activity content element
    Then I should see "Required"
    Then I should see "Identifier 1" in the "Question 1" tui "card"
    And I add a "Text: Long response" activity content element
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | rawTitle | Question 2 |
    And I save the activity content element
    And I close the tui notification toast
