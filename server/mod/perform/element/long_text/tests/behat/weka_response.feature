    And I click on "Submit" "button"
    # The weka front end isn't able to check if the content is only whitespace at the moment,
    # So the form needs to actually be submitted before the validation error is shown (validation is done in the backend)
    # If at some point in the future Weka can do this validation in vue, then the following step can be removed.
    And I confirm the tui confirmation modal
    Then I should see "question1" has the validation error "Question is required"
