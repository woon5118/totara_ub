Description
------------

Face-to-face activities are used to keep track of in-person trainings which
require advance booking.

Each activity is offered in one or more identical sessions.  These sessions
can be given over multiple days.

Reminder messages are sent to users and their managers a few days before the
session is scheduled to start.  Confirmation messages are sent when users
sign-up for a session or cancel.
