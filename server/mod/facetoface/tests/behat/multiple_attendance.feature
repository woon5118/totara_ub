Feature: Take attendance for a seminar with multiple sessions
  Ensure that the correct session is being used to mark activity completion when a seminar has multiple sessions
  To test whether the old or new session date is the current completion date, we run cron, and the older date will expire,
  whereas the newer date will merely open the recert window.
