* In order to allow multiple sheets in an exported file the functions write_header() and write_footer() have
  been removed from core dataformat plugins and have been replaced.
  - write_header() has been replaced with the two functions start_output() and start_sheet().
  - write_footer() has been replaced with the two functions close_output() and close_sheet().
  For backwards compatibility write_header() and write_footer() will continue to work.

* Added new plugin system with low memory support for csv, ods, xls and json
