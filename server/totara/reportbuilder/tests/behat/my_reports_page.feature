    And the following "standard_report" exist in "totara_reportbuilder" plugin:
      | fullname             | shortname                   | source | summary                     | hidden |
      | Custom user report 1 | report_custom_user_report_1 | user   | User report 1 abstract text | 0      |
      | Custom user report 2 | report_custom_user_report_2 | user   | User report 2 abstract text | 0      |
      | Custom user report 3 | report_custom_user_report_3 | user   | User report 3 abstract text | 1      |
    And I log in as "admin"

  Scenario: The my reports page displays reports allowing users to navigate to the report
    Given I click on "Reports" in the totara menu
    Then I should see "Custom user report 1"
    And  I should see "Custom user report 2"
    And "Custom user report 1" "text" should appear before "Custom user report 2" "text"
    When I follow "Custom user report 1"
    Then I should see "Custom user report 1"
    And I should see "2 records shown" in the ".rb-record-count" "css_element"
    When I click on "Reports" in the totara menu
    And I follow "Custom user report 2"
