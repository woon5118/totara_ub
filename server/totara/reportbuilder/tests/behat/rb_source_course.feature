    And I set the following fields to these values:

    And I click on "Save changes" "button"
    And I follow "View This Report"
    # Check the values of the mobile compatibility field.
    Then I should see "No" in the "course_mobilecompatible" report column for "Course 1"
    And I should see "Yes" in the "course_mobilecompatible" report column for "Course 2"
