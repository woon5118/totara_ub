* hierarchy_competency\userdata\competency_progress class has been deprecated, please use totara_competency\userdata\achievement instead.
* Deprecated the use of the following tables:
  * comp_record. Information on the user's latest achievement in a specific competency is now stored in totara_competency_achievement.
    Query with status = 0 to find current achievement value.
  * comp_record_history. Information on a user's previous achievements in a specific competency is also stored in totara_competency_achievement.
    Query with status <> 0 to find previous achievements.
  * comp_criteria_record. Information on a user's completion of courses (evidence) linked to a competency is now stored in totara_criteria_item_record.
* Added minproficiencyid field to the comp_scale table. This should be relied on over the proficient field in the
  comp_scale_values table when determining if a value should be considered proficient.
* totara_competency_scale_proficient_not_in_order has been deprecated. There should always be a minimum proficient id according to the scale.
* totara_competency_scale_proficient_not_in_order has been deprecated. Please use the minproficiencyid value on the scale to ensure proficiency cannot be out of order.
* competency::get_proficiencies has been deprecated. Use competency::get_user_completed_competencies to check what competencies a user has completed.
* Removed deprecated methods:
  * build_nojs_treeview()

  * rb_source_goal_details::rb_display_status_history_link(), please call totara_hierarchy\rb\display\goal_status_history_link::display() instead.

  * rb_source_goal_status_history::rb_display_fullname_link_user(), please call totara_reportbuilder\rb\display\user_link::display() instead.

  * rb_source_goal_status_history::rb_display_scope(), please call totara_hierarchy\rb\display\goal_status_history_link::display() instead.
* Added field totarasync to the comp table
* The method hierarchy::download_ods has had its scope changed from public to protected. To continue using the previous behaviour,
  use hierarchy::download_ods_legacy, which is public.
* The method hierarchy::download_xls has had its scope changed from public to protected. To continue using the previous behaviour,
use hierarchy::download_xls_legacy, which is public.
* The method hierarchy::download_csv has had its scope changed from public to protected. To continue using the previous behaviour,
  use hierarchy::download_csv_legacy, which is public.
* The scheduled task update_competency_task did not scale so it had to be refactored. The refactoring breaks backwards compatibility
  for the method competency_cron_aggregate_evidence(). This method was replaced by a new method called aggregate_competency_evidence_items() which behaviour
  is different to the previous one. Previously there was one big query and loop which went through all competency/user combinations.
  Now all evidence items for a particular user and framework/depth combination are loaded and then passed to this method for aggregation.
  Additionally the method competency_cron_evidence_items() was replaced with a private method run_evidence_type_aggregation_methods(). The old method was deprecated
  in favour of the new one.
