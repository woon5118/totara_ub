    Query with status = 0 to find current achievement value.

  * comp_criteria_record. Information on a user's completion of courses (evidence) linked to a competency is now stored in totara_criteria_item_record.
* Added minproficiencyid field to the comp_scale table. This should be relied on over the proficient field in the
  comp_scale_values table when determining if a value should be considered proficient.
* totara_competency_scale_proficient_not_in_order has been deprecated. There should always be a minimum proficient id according to the scale.
* totara_competency_scale_proficient_not_in_order has been deprecated. Please use the minproficiencyid value on the scale to ensure proficiency cannot be out of order.

  * build_nojs_treeview()
  * build_nojs_breadcrumbs()

* The following mustache templates have been deprecated:
  * totara/hierarchy/templates/competency_view_evidence.mustache
  * totara/hierarchy/templates/competency_view_related.mustache
* totara_hierarchy_renderer::competency_view_evidence has been deprecated in Perform only.

  controller and totara/competency/classes/linked_courses class.
  Information is passed to totara/competency/templates/competency_edit_linkedcourses.mustache.
* totara_hierarchy_renderer::competency_view_related has been deprecated. The functionality is no longer supported.
* hierarchy_can_add_competency_evidence has been moved to from totara/hierarchy/prefix/competency/evidence/lib.php to totara/hierarchy/lib.php.

  * rb_source_goal_custom::rb_display_user_type_name(), please call totara_hierarchy\rb\display\goal_type_name::display() instead.
  * rb_source_goal_custom::rb_display_personal_company(), please call totara_hierarchy\rb\display\goal_personal_company::display() instead.
  * rb_source_goal_details::rb_display_status_history_link(), please call totara_hierarchy\rb\display\goal_status_history_link::display() instead.

* The method hierarchy::download_ods has had its scope changed from public to protected. To continue using the previous behaviour,
  use hierarchy::download_ods_legacy, which is public.
* The method hierarchy::download_xls has had its scope changed from public to protected. To continue using the previous behaviour,
use hierarchy::download_xls_legacy, which is public.
* The method hierarchy::download_csv has had its scope changed from public to protected. To continue using the previous behaviour,
  use hierarchy::download_csv_legacy, which is public.
* The scheduled task update_competency_task did not scale so it had to be refactored. The refactoring breaks backwards compatibility
  for the method competency_cron_aggregate_evidence(). This method was replaced by a new method called aggregate_competency_evidence_items() which behaviour
  is different to the previous one. Previously there was one big query and loop which went through all competency/user combinations.
  Now all evidence items for a particular user and framework/depth combination are loaded and then passed to this method for aggregation.
  Additionally the method competency_cron_evidence_items() was replaced with a private method run_evidence_type_aggregation_methods(). The old method was deprecated
  in favour of the new one.
