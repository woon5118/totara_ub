API Changes:

* prog_update_completion() added a fourth argument to provide the users completion state if already calculated.
* program::__construct() now accepts either an ID or a record from the database during construction.
* program::is_program_complete() now returns a boolean, true when successful false otherwise.

* program::is_accessible() now returns a boolean, true when successful false otherwise.
* program_assignment_category::get_completion() added a third argument $canupdate.
* program_assignment_category::build_table() allowed first argument to be a program instance as well as an id.
This is an abstract method. These changes were applied to this method in its child categories (organisations_category,
positions_category, cohorts_category, managers_category, individuals_category).
* program_assignment_category::build_row() added a second argument $canupdate.

  fulllist, aggregatelist and totalcount.

JavaScript:
* program_assignment.total_count property has been deprecated. Total program assignment count is no longer used.
* program_assignment.is_setup property has been deprecated. This value is no longer used.
* program_assignment.update_total_user_count() has been deprecated. The total program assignment count is no longer used.
* program_assignment.setup() has been deprecated. This called update_total_user_count() which is no longer required.
* category.user_count_label property has been deprecated. There element this referenced is no longer on the page.
* category.update_user_count() has been deprecated. User count totals for categories are no longer used.
* category.check_table_hidden_status() no longer calls category.update_user_count().
* M.totara_programassignment.init no longer calls program_assignment.setup().
* item.update_user_count no longer calls category.update_user_count().
* The elements with classes 'overall_total' and 'user_count' which are used for the total amount of users to potentially be
assigned, respectively, to a program overall and for a category, have been removed. As a result of the changes to JavaScript
described in the points above, if elements with those classes are added back, they will not be updated with new user counts.
