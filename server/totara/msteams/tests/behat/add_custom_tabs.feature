  Scenario: msteams401: Search for non-existent learning catalogue
    Given I am on Microsoft Teams "config" page
    Then the field "Tab name" matches value ""
    And the save button should be "disabled" on Microsoft Teams "config" page

    When I take focus off "Tab name" "field"
    And I set the field "Search the catalog and select an item to be added in a new tab" to ""
