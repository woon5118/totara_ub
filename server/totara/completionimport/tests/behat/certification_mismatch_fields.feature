Feature: Verify the case insensitive shortnames for certification completion imports works as expected
  As an admin
  I import certification completions with case mismatches
  In order to test the case insensitive shortname setting

  Background:
    Given the "mylearning" user profile block exists
    And I am on a totara site
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username  | firstname  | lastname  | email                |
      | learner01 | Bob1       | Learner1  | learner01@example.com |
      | learner02 | Bob2       | Learner2  | learner02@example.com |
      | learner03 | Bob3       | Learner3  | learner03@example.com |
      | learner04 | Bob4       | Learner4  | learner04@example.com |
      | learner05 | Bob5       | Learner5  | learner05@example.com |
      | learner06 | Bob6       | Learner6  | learner06@example.com |
      | learner07 | Bob7       | Learner7  | learner07@example.com |
      | learner08 | Bob8       | Learner8  | learner08@example.com |

    And the following "certifications" exist in "totara_program" plugin:
      | fullname        | shortname | idnumber |
      | Certification 1 | CP101     | c1       |
      | Certification 2 | CP102     | c2       |

    And the following "program assignments" exist in "totara_program" plugin:
      | program  | user      |
      | CP101    | learner01 |
      | CP101    | learner02 |
      | CP101    | learner03 |
      | CP101    | learner04 |
      | CP101    | learner05 |
      | CP101    | learner06 |
      | CP101    | learner07 |
      | CP101    | learner08 |
      | CP102    | learner01 |
      | CP102    | learner02 |
      | CP102    | learner03 |
      | CP102    | learner04 |
      | CP102    | learner05 |
      | CP102    | learner06 |
      | CP102    | learner07 |
      | CP102    | learner08 |

  Scenario: Basic certification completion import case insensitive is turned on
    When I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Upload certification records" node in "Site administration > Courses > Upload completion records"

    And I run the adhoc scheduled tasks "totara_completionimport\task\import_certification_completions_task"

    When I follow "Certification import report"
