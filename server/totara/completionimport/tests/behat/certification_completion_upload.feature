Feature: Verify certification completion data can be successfully uploaded.

  Background:
    Given the "mylearning" user profile block exists
    And I am on a totara site
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname  | lastname  | email                |
      | learner1 | Bob1       | Learner1  | learner1@example.com |

    And the following "certifications" exist in "totara_program" plugin:
      | fullname        | shortname | idnumber |
      | Certification 1 | Cert1     | 1        |

  Scenario: Verify a successful simple certification completion upload.
    Given I log in as "admin"
    When I navigate to "Upload Completion Records" node in "Site administration > Courses > Upload Completion Records"
    And I upload "totara/completionimport/tests/behat/fixtures/certification_completion_1.csv" file to "Certification CSV file to upload" filemanager
    And I set the field "Upload certification Create evidence" to "1"
    And I set the field "Upload certification Import action" to "Certify uncertified users"

    Then I should see "Certification completion file successfully imported"
    And I should see "2 Records imported pending processing"
    And I run all adhoc tasks
