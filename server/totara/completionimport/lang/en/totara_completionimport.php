**Certify if more recent**:

* If a user is already certified and the import completion date is more recent than the current completion date, then the current completion will be moved to history and the user will be marked certified on the imported completion date.
* If a user is already certified and the import completion date is further in the past than the current completion date, then the imported record will be added to history.
* If a user is not currently certified, the imported record will be used to mark them certified.
* If appropriate, the certification window may open and/or expire when cron next runs, causing the completion to be moved to history.

**Notes**:

* If a record is imported for a user who is not assigned to the certification, an individual user assignment will be created for them, causing them to be assigned. Assignment (or reassignment as the case may be) occurs first, then the imported record is processed, regardless of the chosen action or outcome.
