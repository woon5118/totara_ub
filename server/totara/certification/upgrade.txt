This file describes API changes in Totara Certification,
information provided here is intended for developers.

=== 13.2 ===

* Added optional param $ignoreproblemkey to certif_write_completion_history to make it consistent with certif_write_completion

=== 13.0 ===

* Refactored several core program and certification functions. Most program and certification functions are now
  completely separate - you should use the functions specific to the object you are manipulating.
* The event \core\event\course_in_progress was added.
* The following functions were added:
  * certif_set_state_certified
  * certif_set_state_windowopen
  * certif_set_state_expired
  * certif_set_in_progress
* The following were deprecated:
  * certification_event_handler::completed has been deprecated. Instead call certif_set_state_certified directly.
  * certification_event_handler::certification_updated has been deprecated. Instead call \totara_certification\observer::certification_updated.
  * inprogress_certification_stage has been deprecated. Instead trigger a \core\event\course_in_progress event.
  * complete_certification_stage has been deprecated. Instead call certif_set_state_certified directly.
  * write_certif_completion has been deprecated. Instead, use certif_set_state_certified, certif_set_state_windowopen,
    certif_set_state_expired or certif_set_in_progress.
  * set_course_renewalstatus has been deprecated. Renewalstatus is updated as part of certif_create_completion and the
    certif_set_state_xxx functions.
  * reset_certifcomponent_completions has been deprecated. This functionality is included in certif_set_state_windowopen.
* certif_create_completion was changed to create the prog_completion record. You should always allow this
  function to create the prog_completion record for a user assignment in a certification. Use prog_create_completion to
  create the prog_completion record only for a normal program.

=== 12.0 ===

* Removed deprecated methods:
  * certification_event_handler::unassigned()
  * assign_certification_stage()
  * delete_removed_users()
* rb_source_certification_membership::rb_display_edit_completion() has been deprecated, please call totara_certification\rb\display\certif_edit_completion::display() instead.

=== 10.0 ===

* rb_display_certif_status has been moved in to a new style auto-loading class
  display function (\totara_certification\rb\display\certif_status) to use this class
  $this->usedcomponents[] = 'totara_certification'; must be set in the constructor for
  report source.
* certif_create_completion added third optional parameter $message which will be added to the start of relevant logs
* certif_create_completion now creates the prog_completion record when the record is missing, rather than giving an error
* certif_create_completion now deletes "expired" certif_completion_history records when they are used to reassign a user
* certification_event_handler::unassigned() is deprecated. Call certif_conditionally_delete_completion directly instead.
* delete_removed_users() is deprecated. This functionality is already performed in existing Totara code.
* totara_certification_renderer::get_completion_checker_results has been changed - the $data parameter now requires
  fulllist, aggregatelist and totalcount.
