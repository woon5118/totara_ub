  As a user
  I want to use the provided library filters

    Given I am on a totara site
    And I set the site theme to "ventura"

    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email          |
      | user1    | User      | One      | user1@test.com |

    And the following "topics" exist in "totara_topic" plugin:
      | name   |
      | Topic1 |
      | Topic2 |
      | Topic3 |

    And the following "articles" exist in "engage_article" plugin:
      | name           | username | content       | access     | topics |
      | Test Article 1 | user1    | Test Filters  | PUBLIC     | Topic1 |
      | Test Article 2 | user1    | Test Filters  | PRIVATE    | Topic1 |
      | Test Article 3 | user1    | Test Filters  | RESTRICTED | Topic3 |

    And the following "surveys" exist in "engage_survey" plugin:
