    And a competency scale called "ggb" exists with the following values:
      | name    | description          | idnumber       | proficient | default | sortorder |
      | Great   | Is great at doing it | great          | 1          | 0       | 1         |

    And the following "competency" frameworks exist:
      | fullname             | idnumber | description                    | scale  |
      | Competency Framework | fw1      | Framework for Competencies     | ggb    |
    And the following "competency" hierarchy exists:
      | framework | fullname   | idnumber | description       | parent |
      | fw1       | Parent     | parent   | Parent competency |        |
      | fw1       | Child1     | child1   | First child       | parent |
      | fw1       | Child2     | child2   | Second child      | parent |
      | fw1       | Another    | another  | Some other        |        |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname    | shortname | enablecompletion |
      | Course 1    | course1   | 1                |
      | Course 2    | course2   | 1                |
      | Course 3    | course3   | 1                |
      | No tracking | notrack   | 0                |

  Scenario: Add multiple achievement paths for a competency
    Given I log in as "admin"

    And I click on "Add raters" "button" in "manual" pathway "2" "before" criteria groups
    And I toggle the legacy adder list entry "Self" in "Select raters"
    And I save my legacy selections and close the "Select raters" adder
    And I wait for pending js
    Then I should see "Self" in "manual" pathway "2" "before" criteria groups

  Scenario: Removing multi-value pathways doesn't impact the display of criteria-based block
