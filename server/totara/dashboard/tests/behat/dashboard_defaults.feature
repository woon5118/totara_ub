Feature: Test Dashboard defaults
    In order to test the correct behaviour related to the visibility settings for the dashboard feature
    As a admin
    I need to choose among the three different settings (show/hide/disabled) and check the GUI

  Background:
    Given I am on a totara site
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                   |
      | student1 | Student   | One      | student.one@example.com |
    # Login to get the Latest announcements created.
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I set the following administration settings values:
      | allowdefaultpageselection | 1 |

    And I turn editing mode on
    And I add the "Latest announcements" block
    And I am on "Dashboard" page
