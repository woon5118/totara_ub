Feature: Tenant behat generator functionality

  As a developer
  In order to speed up adding of behat coverage
  I want to use tenant data generators

  Background:
    Given I am on a totara site

  Scenario: Tenant support is disabled by default
    Given I log in as "admin"

    When I navigate to "System information > Configure features > Shared services settings" in site administration
    Then the field "Enable multitenancy support" matches value "0"

    When I click on "[aria-label='Show admin menu window']" "css_element"
    Then I should not see "Tenants" in the "#quickaccess-popover-content" "css_element"

    When I navigate to "Permissions > Define roles" in site administration
    Then I should not see "Tenant user manager"
    And I should not see "Tenant domain manager"

  Scenario: Tenant behat generator turns on tenant support without tenant isolation
    When tenant support is enabled without tenant isolation
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I click on "[aria-label='Show admin menu window']" "css_element"
    Then I should see "Tenants" in the "#quickaccess-popover-content" "css_element"

    When I navigate to "Development > Experimental > Experimental settings" in site administration
    Then the field "Enable tenant isolation" matches value "0"

    When I navigate to "Permissions > Define roles" in site administration
    Then I should see "Tenant user manager"
    And I should see "Tenant domain manager"

  Scenario: Tenant behat generator may turn on tenant support with full tenant isolation
    When tenant support is enabled with full tenant isolation
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I click on "[aria-label='Show admin menu window']" "css_element"
    Then I should see "Tenants" in the "#quickaccess-popover-content" "css_element"

    When I navigate to "Development > Experimental > Experimental settings" in site administration
    Then the field "Enable tenant isolation" matches value "1"

    When I navigate to "Permissions > Define roles" in site administration
    Then I should see "Tenant user manager"
    And I should see "Tenant domain manager"

  Scenario: Tenant behat generator creates tenant instances
    Given tenant support is enabled without tenant isolation
    When the following "tenants" exist:
