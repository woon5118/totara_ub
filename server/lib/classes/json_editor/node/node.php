/**
 * Base class for all the node.
 * The data structure of a node can be something like below
 *
 * node => [
 *      'type' => 'string',
 *      'content' => [node, node],
 *      'attrs' => [
 *          ...mixed
 *      ],
 *      'marks' => [
 *          'type' => 'string,
 *          'attrs' => [
 *              ...mixed
 *          ]
 *      ]
 * ]
 *
 * To provide the json data sample for your own node, please put it in the fixtures directory of
 * your component - where you are introducing the new node. Please note that it has to be under
 * subdirectory json_editor/node with the same filename as your own node.
 *
 * For example, if you introduced new node 'special_node' type located in your component with the directory path as
 * '/root-project/your/component/classes/json_editor/node/special_node.php'. Then the sample json data for your node
 * can be located in '/root-project/your/component/tests/fixtures/json_editor/node/special_node.php'.
 *
 * By default, every node will provide a rendered content in HTML and also in text. Whether to use the front-end
 * components to display the node differently is up to the formatter.
