  Background:
    Given I am on a totara site
    And I set the site theme to "ventura"

    And the following "users" exist:

      | user1    | User      | One      | user1@example.com |
      | user2    | User      | Two      | user2@example.com |

    And the following "topics" exist in "totara_topic" plugin:
      | name   |
      | Topic1 |

    And the following "workspaces" exist in "container_workspace" plugin:
      | name             | summary   | owner |
      | Test Workspace 1 | Workspace | user1 |

    And I set the weka editor to "New article"
    And I wait for the next second
    And I click on "Next" "button"
    And I wait for the next second

    # Confirm that we can see the automatically added workspace recipient.
