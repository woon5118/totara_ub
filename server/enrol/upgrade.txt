This files describes API changes in /enrol/* - plugins,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 13.3 ===

* Added "user_full_name" parameter of type string to core_enrol_renderer::user_roles_and_actions

=== 13.0 ===

* Added a new optional argument $preventredirect to the try_autoenrol functions.
* MNET functionality is deprecated and will be removed in Totara 14

=== 12.0 ===

* External function core_enrol_external::get_users_courses now return the user progress, start and the end course dates.

=== 10.0 ===

* External function core_enrol_external::get_users_courses now return the category id as an additional optional field.
* core_enrol_external::get_enrolled_users now supports two additional parameters for ordering: sortby and sortdirection.
* Enrolment plugins UI have been consolidated. Plugins can implement use_standard_editing_ui() function
  and add edit_instance_form() and edit_instance_validation() methods instead of providing their own edit.php and form.
  They can then rely on the default implementation of get_action_icons and get_course_navigation. In future this will
  mean they can be called by webservices/user upload tools because they can validate their data.
